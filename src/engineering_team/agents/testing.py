"""Testing agent: derives the coverage a change is required to demonstrate from the
product specification, then reports how much of it the executed suite actually shows.

Deliberately deterministic. Classification is keyword-driven rather than model-driven so
the coverage claim is reproducible and auditable: the same specification and the same
executed tests always produce the same mapping, and every entry points at evidence the
run really recorded. A dimension with no matching evidence is reported empty; it is
never filled with a placeholder.
