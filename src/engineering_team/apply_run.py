"""Run the full engineering workflow directly against a real, external project.

Unlike ``observability.evaluation.run_multimodel_acceptance`` (which always
works against an isolated copy of the bundled ``sample_app``), this module
points Repository/Quality MCP at a caller-supplied project path. When the
Reviewer approves and ``authorize_writes=True``, the Developer's LLM-authored
file content is written for real via ``create_file``/``update_file`` — see
``ImplementationResult.file_contents`` and the write block in
``graph.stategraph.build_engineering_graph``.
